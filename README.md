Application to the railway commuter network of Madrid"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the data used for the article "**Monitoring network infrastructures with drones: Application to the railway commuter network of Madrid**". 
by David Canca, José Miguel León Blanco, José Luis Andrade Pineda, Pedro Luis González-R and Marcos Calle

The description of the network is included as a Python File named **"Cercanias_madrid.py"** containing the network stations and the links connecting these stations  for the Commuter Railway Network of Madrid. 

The Python File also contains the scale of the network, so that it is possible to obtain the coordinates of nodes and the length of segments.

A second little network used to develop the code is included in the file "**"Red_prueba_mini.py"**".
